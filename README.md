## My process

  Oh boy was this a process. I did the full thing using Bootstrap to begin, but realized there were elements of CSS that Bootstrap helped me in not knowing.
  Due to the CSS gaps in my knowledge, I decided to fully start over using pure CSS to attempt this. It took many hours (sadly) but I'm happy with the result.

  Could use a few tweaks, open to criticism..

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### Continued development

I absolutely still need help with flexbox, and general CSS grid work. I feel like I could have positioned the box in a smarter way, and am, again, open to suggestions.
